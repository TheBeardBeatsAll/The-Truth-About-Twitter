# The-Truth-About-Twitter
Computer Science final year project
Web application that users can input a Twitter handle into.
Data about the account linked to that handle is retrieved from the Twitter API.
This data is passed into a machine-learning model which makes a decision on 
whether the account is real or a type of spam bot.
Results are then shown on screen for the user to see.

Datasets are too large to upload and as such can be found at their source:
