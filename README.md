# The-Truth-About-Twitter
Computer Science Final Year Project

Data mining and machine learning algorithms used to create models that can
accurately predict whether a Twitter account is real or not.

Datasets used are too large to upload and as such can be found at their source:

A simple web app makes use of these models, allowing a user to check any Twitter 
account they wish and share results to Facebook & Twitter ( Works when deployed via AWS )
